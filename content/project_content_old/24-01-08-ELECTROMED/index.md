A fast, inexpensive, and effective proteomics platform could transform personalised medicine

The genome comprises all our genes and our genes are the instructions for the synthesis of all the proteins our body makes (proteome) to carry out its myriad of functions. The human genome codes for about 20 000 different proteins but variations in splicing can tremendously amplify that number. Since they are ubiquitous and play a critical role in disease, proteins and even pieces of them (peptides) are important disease biomarkers and therapy targets. Proteomics has tremendous potential for personalised medicine yet faces challenges in terms of the variety of targets and subsequent specificity, sensitivity, throughput, and cost. ElectroMed is building a platform that could overcome these issues, providing a quantum leap in proteomics for personalised medicine and much more.
