In this part of our work, we are performing numerical first principal  simulations of various materials
 
<!--more-->

We use quantum mechanical first principal models based on Density Functional Theory for material simulations. Moreover, in partnerships with our industrial partners, we are developing theoretical models which will describe the complexity of the material growth process and defect formation in various materials. In addition, we are using this materials simulation to calculate the optical and electronic properties not only for bulk materials but also molecules and electronic devices.
