We are building a unique simulation framework that combines machine learning methods and device simulation techniques. 

<!--more-->

Our unique device modelling methodology is based on the combination of machine learning methods and ‘classical’ device simulations. We have developed a unique simulation framework that combines quantum mechanical nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) approach, and the ML method is an extension of a convolutional generative network. We have named our new simulation approach ML-NEGF. It is implemented in our in-house simulator called Nano-Electronics Simulation Software (NESS). The output of the simulation tool is an improved convergence speed of the ML-NEGF method in comparison to the “standard” NEGF approach.
