Vihar will lead the University of Glasgow’s contribution to APRIL and he will be supported by Professor Hadi Heidari and Professor Bo Liu, all of them from the James Watt School of Engineering.

The AI Hub for Productive Research and Innovation in Electronics, or APRIL, is one of nine new artificial intelligence research hubs across the country that will deliver next-generation innovations and technologies. The new hubs are supported by £80m in new funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).

APRIL will develop AI tools to accelerate the development of key components such as new semiconductor materials, integrated circuits, complex microchip designs and system architectures - leading to faster, cheaper, greener and overall more power-efficient electronics.
