DeepNano Group at University of Glasgow is led by Prof. Vihar Georigiev and it is extension of Device Modelling Group led by Prof. Asen Asen. DeepNano group was founded on 1st of January 2024. The aim of the group is to continue the research in modelling and simulations domain of electronic devices by combining not only analytical and numerical approaches but also machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. 

The group is a world leader in the statistical 3D simulation of advanced CMOS devices, which include different sources of statistical variability and material's defects. Our projects are in collaboration with leading experimental groups, such as IBM, STMicroelectronics, IMEC, Synopsys and Synopsys QuantumATK. Our group collaborates with academic groups not only in UK but also from USA, China, South Korea, India, Japan, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, France, Italy, Poland, Germany and Bulgaria. We are supporting open science practices and we are happy to collaborate with everyone interested in our work.
