**DeepNano Group** is based at [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) an it is led by [Prof. Vihar Georgiev](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/vihargeorgiev/#). DeepNano is a complementary research group to [Device Modelling Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/devmod/) led by [Prof. Asen Asenov](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/asenasenov/). 

**DeepNano Group** was founded on 1st of January 2024. The aim of the group is to continue the research in modelling and simulations areas of electronic devices by combining not only analytical and numerical approaches but also machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. The **DeepNano Group** research activities are focused on the modelling and simulation of nanoscale devices for advanced optoelectronics, biosensors and quantum applications. 

Our projects are in collaboration with leading experimental and simulation groups from all over the World, such as IBM, STMicroelectronics, IMEC, Synopsys and Synopsys QuantumATK. Our group collaborates with academic groups not only in UK but also from USA, China, South Korea, India, Japan, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, France, Italy, Poland, Germany and Bulgaria. We are supporting open science practices and we are happy to collaborate with everyone interested in our work.
