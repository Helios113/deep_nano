**DeepNano Group** is based at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) and it is led by [Prof. Vihar Georgiev](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/vihargeorgiev/#). **DeepNano Group**  is part of [Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre (GCEC)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gcec/). 
 

**DeepNano Group** is a research group based at the University of Glasgow, and it is led by Prof. Vihar Georgiev. The aim of the group is to develop new simulation methods and tools in the areas of modelling and simulation of electronic devices by combining not only analytical and numerical approaches but also machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. 

Our projects are in collaboration with leading experimental and simulation groups from all over the World, such as IBM, STMicroelectronics, IMEC, Synopsys and Synopsys QuantumATK. Our group collaborates with academic groups not only in the UK but also from USA, China, South Korea, India, Japan, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, France, Italy, Poland, Germany and Bulgaria. We are supporting open science practices and we are happy to collaborate with everyone interested in our work.
