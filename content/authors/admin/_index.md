I am a [Professor of Nanoelectronics](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/vihargeorgiev/#) and the Leader of the **DeepNano Group** at University of Glasgow. I have more than 10 years of experience of developing numerical solvers and machine learning methods that are used for modelling and simulations of various semiconductor devices, such as nanowire transistors, tunnelling FETs, molecular flash memories and bio-sensors not only on IV and III-V semiconductor but also molecules, carbon nanotubes and Josephsonâ€™s junctions.
