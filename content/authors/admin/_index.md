Vihar is a [Professor of Nanoelectronics](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/vihargeorgiev/#) and the Leader of the **DeepNano Group** at the University of Glasgow. Vihar is also a Visiting Professor at TU Vienna. He has more than 10 years of experience in developing numerical solvers and machine learning methods that are used for modelling and simulations of various semiconductor devices, such as [nanowire transistors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7847436), [tunnelling FETs](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/abd125), [biosensors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038110122001460), [current transport in inorganic molecules](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c11038), [Josephson’s junctions](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/ac5f2e), [physical unclonable functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038110122001113?via%3Dihub) and [molecular flash memories](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13951).

Vihar has participated in 12 European and UK projects in total. From 2018 until 2022 he held an EPSRC Industrial Fellowship called Quantum Simulator for Entangled Electronics (EP/S001131/1) and currently he is a co-PI of three more EPSRC projects (EP/T023244/1, EP/V032627/1 and EP/V048341/1). Moreover, he is a PI of two EU H2020 projects. The first one is a H2020-FetOPEN-2019 project called [ElectroMed](https://www.electromed.eu/) and the second one is a MSCA-ITN-2019 project called [DESIGN-EID](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/design-eid/) where he is also a project coordinator. Since his appointment as a Lecturer in 2015, he has  secured funding of around £1.3M as a PI and around £3.0M as a co-PI.
