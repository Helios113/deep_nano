Luiz is a [Lecturer in Computational Nanoelectronics](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/luizaguinsky/) and Deputy Group Leader of the DeepNano Group at the University of Glasgow. He has experience in developing and employing advanced computational methods that develop insights into the fabrication and operation of state-of-the-art and next-generation nano(opto)electronic devices. More specifically, he has experience in machine-learning-enhanced atomistic modelling of switching phenomena in optically-stimulated memristors – a promising technology enabling neuromorphic computing. He is also experienced in semiconductor process simulation, with a particular focus on atomic layer deposition/etching for advanced memory technologies.

Previously, he was an [Erwin Schrödinger Fellow](https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-radar/10.55776/J4686) at the [Computational Electronics Group of ETH Zurich](https://nano-tcad.ee.ethz.ch/research/computational-nanoelectronics.html). During his doctoral studies, he was a member of the [Christian Doppler Laboratory in High Performance TCAD](https://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/hptcad/), where he obtained his PhD with distinction. Luiz is a member of the [Technical Committee on Modelling and Simulation](https://ieeenano.org/modeling-and-simulation-tc) of the [IEEE Nanotechnology Council](https://ieeenano.org/).
