Lado Filipovic is an Associate Professor at TU Wien, working on Integrated Semiconductor Sensors and Process Simulation. He obtained his venia docendi (habilitation) in Semiconductor Based Integrated Sensors and his doctoral degree (Dr.techn.) in Microelectronics from TU Wien in 2020 and 2012, respectively. He holds a Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Sciences (MASc.) from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, which he obtained in 2009. He has been a Principal Investigator in various research projects funded by, e.g., the EU FP7 and Horizon 2020 programs, the Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft, the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). He is a Senior Member of the IEEE and is an active member of the Technical Program Committee for outstanding IEEE sponsored conferences, such as IEEE Sensors, SISPAD, and IIRW. He has served as a reviewer for several funding agencies, has edited two books on Miniaturized Transistors, and is an active reviewer for many leading journals.

Lado's primary research interest is studying the operation, stability, and reliability of novel semiconductor-based sensors using advanced process and device simulations. An additional pillar of his research is the multi-scale modeling of processes involved in the fabrication of semiconductor devices and sensors. This involves combining atomistic modeling with Monte Carlo and continuum approaches, as well as merging physical and empirical modeling in a single framework, specifically in process TCAD. He is also actively investigating metal oxide semiconductors and novel two-dimensional (2D) materials, e.g., graphene, MoS2, and phosphorene for the detection of biomarkers and environmental pollutants. In particular, his group is investigating the impact of the adsorption of ambient gas molecules on the surfaces of 2D semiconducting films and on the performance of devices and sensors based on these.
