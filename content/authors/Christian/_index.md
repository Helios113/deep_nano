# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Christian is an PhD student in an H2020 MSCA EU project called DESING-EID. His is developing theoretical models which can describe the complexity of the material growth process and defect formation in III-V materials. Those models are implemented in state-of-the-art QuantumATK commercial simulation framework.
