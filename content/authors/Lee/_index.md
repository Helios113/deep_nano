At present, within the semiconductor market, there is a growing enthusiasm for customized semiconductors that are fine-tuned for specific purposes, as opposed to standard chips. Our lab places its main emphasis on developing vital TCAD simulation tools, using artificial intelligence algorithms, to push forward the advancement of next-gen semiconductor technology. This includes enhancing devices, manufacturing fabrication processes, and circuits. Additionally, we delve into the study of cryogenic semiconductors to contribute to the development of quantum computers and energy-efficient devices.
