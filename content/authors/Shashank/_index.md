# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Enrico is an PhD student in an H2020 MSCA EU project called Intuitive. His work is mainly focus to develop the in-silico model of skin to investigate the transduction mechanism in soft-skin at molecular scale. He is developing the in-silico models of skin by considering the receptors in soft skin at various depths and role of various soft materials.
