Ankit is working as a Research Associate with the DeepNano group, University of Glasgow, Scotland headed by Prof. Vihar Georgiev. Here, he is responsible for conducting nano electronics device simulations, such as GAA FET, FinFET etc. for the project entitled “Probing the States of Single Molecules for Sensing and Multi-value Memory Applications”. He is also a  member of various technical societies, such as IEEE, ISTE, IETE etc.  He has completed his Ph.D. in the discipline of Electronics and Communication Engineering at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design, and Manufacturing,  Jabalpur, India and he carried out his research under  supervision of Dr Dip Prakash Samajdar in the area of III-V materials, such as InGaAs, GaAsSb, InGaSb for the application of low power devices and biosensor applications.

He has published numerous articles in prestigious national and international publications and conference proceedings, such as IEEE, Elsevier, Springer, and others. He was the recipient of a research scholarship from the Indian Ministry of Human and Resource Development (MHRD). Earlier, he held a position of section vice-chair for the IEEE nanotechnology council (NTC) chapter and served as the secretary for the IEEE student branch of PDPM IIITDM, Jabalpur, India.
